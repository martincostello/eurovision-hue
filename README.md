## Introduction

Updates your Hue lights to follow along with the Eurovision Song Contest.

This project was inspired by the [cnorthwood/eurovisionhue][inspiration] project.

## Building and Testing

Compiling the application yourself requires Git and the [.NET SDK][dotnet-sdk] to be installed.

To build and test the application locally from a terminal/command-line, run the
following set of commands:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/martincostello/eurovision-hue.git
cd eurovision-hue
./build.ps1
```

## Running with Docker

To run the application using Docker, you will need to have [Docker][docker] installed.

First, build the Docker image for the application by running the following command in a terminal:

```terminal
docker build --tag eurovision-hue .
```

Finally, run the application using the following command:

```terminal
docker run --interactive --tty --rm --mount type=volume,src=eurovision-hue,dst=/app/MartinCostello/EurovisionHue eurovision-hue
```

The `eurovision-hue` volume is used to persist the configuration of the application.
